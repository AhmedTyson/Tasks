## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Microsoft SQL Server (2016 or later)
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- Windows Authentication or SQL Server Authentication

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/collegedb-management-system.git
   cd collegedb-management-system
   ```

2. **Database Creation**
   ```sql
   -- Execute the main script
   sqlcmd -S your_server -i CollegeDB-Task-5.sql
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**
   ```sql
   USE CollegeDB;
   -- Check tables
   SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES;
   -- Verify sample data
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Person;
   ```

4. **Configure Security (Optional)**
   ```sql
   -- Test role-based access
   EXEC sp_helprolemember 'RegistrarRole';
   ```

## Usage

### Quick Start Examples

#### Student Enrollment
```sql
-- Enroll a student in a course
EXEC sp_EnrollStudent @StudentID = 7, @CourseID = 1001;
```

#### Grade Management
```sql
-- Update student grade
EXEC sp_UpdateGrade @StudentID = 7, @CourseID = 1001, @Grade = 3.8;
```

#### Analytics Dashboard
```sql
-- View top performing students
SELECT TOP 10 * FROM vw_StudentSummary 
WHERE GPA IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY GPA DESC;
```

#### Department Performance
```sql
-- Analyze department statistics
SELECT * FROM vw_DepartmentStats 
ORDER BY AvgGPA DESC;
```

### Administrative Queries

#### Course Management
```sql
-- Find courses with no enrolled students
SELECT c.CourseID, c.Title, d.Name AS Department
FROM Course c
JOIN Department d ON c.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
LEFT JOIN StudentGrade sg ON c.CourseID = sg.CourseID
WHERE sg.CourseID IS NULL;
```

#### Faculty Workload Analysis
```sql
-- Instructor teaching load
SELECT * FROM vw_InstructorWorkload 
ORDER BY CoursesTeaching DESC;
```
